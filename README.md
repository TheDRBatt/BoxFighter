# BoxFighter
Final Project for Client-Server Systems course uploaded for archiving purposes.

To play, compile everything, run an instance of BoxFightServer, and run two instances of main. Online play is possible by editting host in BoxFighter to connect to the ip address of BoxFightServer's machine. Do not expect it to play well in its current state.
